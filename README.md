# Automatic-Door-Opener
This project demonstrates a simple **automatic door opener** system using an **Arduino Uno**, a **PIR motion sensor**, and a **servo motor**. When motion is detected near the door, the servo motor opens the door automatically, provides visual and audible feedback using LEDs and a buzzer, and then closes the door after a short delay.
