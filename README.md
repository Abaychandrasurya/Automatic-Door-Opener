# üîì Automatic Door Opener using Arduino Uno and PIR Sensor

This project demonstrates a simple **automatic door opener** system using an **Arduino Uno**, a **PIR motion sensor**, and a **servo motor**. When motion is detected near the door, the servo motor opens the door automatically, provides visual and audible feedback using LEDs and a buzzer, and then closes the door after a short delay.

## üì¶ Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- PIR Motion Sensor (HC-SR501 or equivalent)
- Servo Motor (SG90/MG90S)
- Buzzer
- Red LED
- Green LED
- Push Button (optional for manual override)
- Resistors (220Œ© for LEDs)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable for programming and power

## üõ†Ô∏è Working Principle

1. **PIR Motion Detection**  
   The PIR sensor continuously monitors for motion within its field of view.

2. **Servo-Based Door Movement**  
   When motion is detected, the servo motor rotates to simulate door opening (typically 90¬∞), waits for a few seconds, and returns to its original position (0¬∞) to close the door.

3. **Visual and Audible Feedback**  
   - Green LED turns on during motion detection and door open.
   - Red LED remains on when no motion is detected (door closed).
   - Buzzer provides a short beep as an alert when the door is activated.

4. **Optional Button Control**  
   A push button can be added as a manual trigger or override.

| Servo Signal     | D9               |
| Red LED (+)      | D4 (via 220Œ©)    |
| Green LED (+)    | D5 (via 220Œ©)    |
| Buzzer (+)       | D6               |
| Button (optional)| D3               |
| VCC (PIR/Servo)  | 5V               |
| GND              | GND              |
